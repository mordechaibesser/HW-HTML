Makeup Quiz:
Some people wanted a makeup quiz. Below is a makeup exercise. Submit as usual to the same folder as the regular hw. I recommend that everyone do it, even if only as an exercise. (Same rules as usual, google anything, look at anything, can't ask someone (or something...) direct questions that tell you how to do it...)

Quiz:
Create 40 people where a person has a unique id, a first name, a last name, and a gender.
Make 20 male, and 20 female. (its ok if names are not unique, two people can have the same name - ids must be unique though)
Pair them up to each so that each has a spouse of the opposite gender and no spouse is used twice - or left out.
Print out the people to the console, maybe something like this:

id 0, first: Bill, last: Obama, gender: m, spouse: Michelle Clinton - 1
id 1, first: Michelle, last: Clinton, gender: f, spouse: Bill Obama - 0
id 2, first: Bill, last: Biden, gender: m, spouse: Jill Biden - 3
id 3, first: Jill, last: Biden, gender: f, spouse: Bill Biden - 2
<snip..>
id 38, first: Bill, last: Clinton, gender: m, spouse: Melania Clinton - 39
id 39, first: Melania, last: Clinton, gender: f, spouse: Bill Clinton - 38

It should not be possible to be able to see anything about these people from another JavaScript file (no globals).

I would expect that you would have some lists of names and be using Math.random to pick random ones similar to how we picked random colors in some other examples. I don't expect you to be hand coding 40 people...
